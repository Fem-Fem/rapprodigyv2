I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes\nI know the shit you goin' through the last month\nYou stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt\nA nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk\nYou can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch\nUh, ramen noodles on the regular\nAdd some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch\nPeanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera\nAnd we just flyin' in the nebula\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it'll be alright\n[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]\nI done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'\nFinally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment\nOut South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman\nRoundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul\nConfused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place\nSome of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase\nI know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace\nI had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste\nI promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates\nThey used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape\nDo that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid\nDon't ever think it's sweet, that's that cr\u00e8me de la br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nWho they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy\nMy wifey yellin', \"Who they?\" My daughter yellin', \"Hooray\"\nI see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky\nI keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye\nLike a stye (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nSo don't you shed a tear\n'Cause there'll be better years\nI live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear\nGod cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears\nThe feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here\n'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means\nA young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things\nAge 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans\nYou know they a little extra faded around the knees\nWith the grass stains in 'em\nI really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it\nPain, I defeated it, and brought back\nSoul survivor, nigga, what you call that?\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it's gon' be alright\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright"

Uh\nLook in the mirror like, \"Boy, you look good\"\nYeah, that's right, had to pick up myself, uh (Pick up myself)\nI'm doin' me, you should do you, fuck everybody else\nDon't need nobody else\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nUh, you can be who you wanna be\nBut rather be myself, for real\nNo pretending, no faking me\n'Cause gettin' out this shell is real\nI don't know where I'm headed next, but\nMan, I can't even fake no more\nSurrounded by lies and bullshit\nNigga, I can't even take no more\nSee, I woke up havin' a bad day\nAnd I gotta get the dollar any faster way\n'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit\nI was actin' way too passive\nI've been up and down, 'round and 'round\nTryna find my way back home\nGone too long, drownin' out\nStill gonna play that song"

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Meek Mill]\nYeah, God bless the dreamchasers\nIf you got a dream, keep chasin' it\nNever let nobody here trap your dreams\nYou gon' make it, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it\n\n[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]\nSee I know how it feels on the late nights, swimmin' with the great whites\nDrownin' in the deep waters, know you got three daughters\nCould use some resources, nah, we just need order\nI got my own bad news, fuck a reporter\nNiggas ain't even safe, they wanna deport us\nOr rather keep us boxed in on the street corners\nIf you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us\nMy dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us\nFar from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students\nSparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music\nGot me thinkin' like this can't be life\nThese stupid ass niggas voted for the Antichrist\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nIt was hell here, my people killin' and it's 12 here\nGot my mom a Black Card and she was just on welfare, that's goals\nDid it on my own, I got myself here\nWhen God asked me do I want this shit? I said, \"Hell yeah\"\nI'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy\nI was drownin' in my past like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans\nIn my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan\nEvery move I make like chess, it's important\nI just went against the system, spending nights tryna reform it\nLay at night thinkin' I could lose my life just from doin' this\nIt's a sacrifice, I know it wouldn't be right if I forfeit\nBut I do it for the young kings that never had no voices, for real\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nYeah, okay, I reminisce the cold days in wintertime, got home by dinner time\n7-Eleven runs, Gatorade flavor lemon-lime\nHot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine\nThe first job I ever applied for was Finish Line\nSometimes a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm\nSavior of the rap shit, the leader of the renaissance\nSelf-appointed, well anointed for my endeavors\nI'm eyein' cheddar, applyin' pressure, defyin' set-ups\nThe rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better\nIf truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never\nNo, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life\nI heard Meek hook and I told him to sing it twice, my God\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it"
